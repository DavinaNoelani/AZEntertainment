### ðŸŽ­ AZEntertainment â€“ Group Project

---

### ðŸ“„ Project Overview

AZEntertainment is a full-stack event management application that allows users to create, browse, and purchase tickets for events. Key features include user authentication, image upload via Cloudinary, and Stripe payment integration. The app was developed as part of a full-time web development bootcamp.

### ðŸ‘¥ Collaboration Context

This project was built by a team of justice-impacted developers during a web development bootcamp facilitated by Persevere and Banyan Labs. While we worked in a static, offline environment without internet access, we simulated real-world development practices and collaborated using shared local drives and code handoffs. We were introduced to GitHub after the program, applying our knowledge post-release.
